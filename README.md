# AutoFocusThresholdCharacterSegment

#### 1. Description
This program is for characters segmentation and restoration of Qin-Han bamboo slips.

This algorithm was motivated by method of auto-focus.

This program is the souce code of paper **"Character segmentation and restoration of Qin-Han bamboo slips using local auto-focus thresholding method".**

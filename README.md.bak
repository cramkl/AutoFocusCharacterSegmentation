# Auto Focus Threshold Character Segment

#### 1. Description
* This program is for characters segmentation and restoration of Qin-Han bamboo slips, the idea of this algorithm was motivated by method of camera auto-focus process.

* This program is the souce code of paper **"Character segmentation and restoration of Qin-Han bamboo slips using local auto-focus thresholding method".**

* Please cite the following paper if you use this code:
